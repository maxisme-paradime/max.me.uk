There are lots of positives to this and I always tell people who are beginning to code to do this. It can be quite dull following some YouTube tutorial to build a tic-tac-toe game when you are not at all interested in the game tic-tac-toe. I think people who code should be inspired to build things. But this does come at a caveat...\n\n# How I got into programming\n\nI started programming because I wanted to make a fashion brand with a friend of mine from College and we needed a website. I wasn't at all interested in being able to write PHP, JavaScript, HTML, SQL, etc... at the time - I just wanted to build an online shop myself.\n\nI got great satisfaction from making new features like a blog page and a CMS panel... and I slowly got more and more interested in building a new feature on the website than I did selling t-shirts.\n\nI had no friends or family who were interested in computers or coding all I wanted was to build features so for a long time I found myself copying and pasting code snippets from StackOverflow -  I was constantly building MVPs but without knowing it I was fading too far in the direction of wanting to build a new feature than caring about software engineering best practices - I didn't have the foggiest about project structure, SQL injection, Git, etc... I was publishing all my new changes to the site over SFTP to a random CPannel host.\n\nFast forward a year and I decided to study Comp Sci at uni. I began to learn about making my code more efficient, secure and readable while writing incredibly boring programs in mainly Java. I also, more importantly, found other people with the same interests as me who would expose me to these best practices and give me advice on programming... and for the first time I was exposed to **learning through listening**...\n\n# Should I be listening or doing at my new role?\n\nJump to now - at my new job (and second software engineer job since graduating) we are working remotely,  which has its pros and cons - mainly cons. Most of my new peers have \"zoom fatigue\" which is completely understandable and I couldn't think of anything worse than an hour long zoom call at my previous place towards the end. The problem however is that the pandemic has made it more difficult for me to **learn through listening**.\n\nI understand that at my current place I am not being payed to learn but I personally believe that spending time speaking to other devs about their practices and what hoops they have had to jump through will save me a lot of time in the long run...\n\nHowever this can be completely argued by spinning it the other way - by discovering things by myself I will learn a lot of surrounding things such as structure of the code base,  best practices, etc... Opposed to being given the answer immediately.  I can also then share this knew found knowledge with the other developers at knowledge sharing sessions. There is also another negative to asking questions - I will be wasting the other devs time and their time at this moment is obviously a lot more valuable than mine as I am still learning the code bases and systems.\n\nThere are also different types of devs there are the people who love to help others as they get satisfaction out of teaching people and there are devs who love getting features out as soon as possible (Something working remote makes harder to gauge) This is definitely not binary.\n\nFor example: I was given the advice on instead of asking lots of small questions just ask one large question but I believe this is very dependent on the person you are asking - I personally prefer lots of small questions as I don't want to have to sit and read an essay and in turn have to potentially write an essay back. But by sending one large message you are giving the person more time to respond and arguably make them feel less inundated.\n\nA message on slack is very official - it requires a written thought-out response, takes a a lot longer and requires much more brain power. Opposed to an asynchronous mumbled response you can get while sat next to the person in an office when asking something like _\"shall I make this variable a constant?\"._ You can't write code and write a slack message at exactly the same time.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIt is a very interesting problem and I have no \"side\" on the issue.  This problem is obviously emphasized in the pandemic but I have definitely gone through a similar problem pre-pandemic. For example when do you invest time in writing a question on a forum or chat room vs just googling it yourself.\n\nI would love to hear from others on how they weigh up when to find out something by themself vs asking for help."
