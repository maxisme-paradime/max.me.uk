content = "I have just started a new software engineering role and I am really enjoying it so far although I am struggling with one thing - when to ask for help vs when to find out myself.\n\nThroughout my career as a software engineer I have been **learning by doing**. There are lots of positives to this and I always tell people who are beginning to code to do this. It can be quite dull following some YouTube tutorial to build a tic-tac-toe game when you are not at all interested in the game tic-tac-toe. I think people who code should be inspired to build things. But this does come at a caveat...\n\n# How I started programming\n\nI started programming because I wanted to make a fashion brand with a friend of mine from College and we needed a website. I wasn't at all interested in being able to write PHP, JavaScript, HTML, SQL, etc... at the time - I just wanted to build an online shop myself.\n\nI got great satisfaction from making new features like a blog page and a CMS panel... and I slowly got more and more interested in building a new feature on the website than I did selling t-shirts.\n\nI had no friends or family who were interested in computers or coding all I wanted was to build features so for a long time I found myself copying and pasting code snippets from StackOverflow -  I was constantly building MVPs but without knowing it I was fading too far in the direction of wanting to build a new feature than caring about software engineering best practices - I didn't have the foggiest about project structure, SQL injection, Git, etc... I was publishing all my new changes to the site over SFTP to a random CPannel host.\n\nFast forward a year and I decided to study Comp Sci at uni. I began to learn about making my code more efficient, secure and readable while writing incredibly boring programs in mainly Java. I also, more importantly, found other people with the same interests as me who would expose me to these best practices and give me advice on programming... and for the first time I was exposed to **learning through listening**...\n\n# Should I be listening or doing at my new role?\n\nJump to now - at my new job (and second software engineer job since graduating) we are working remotely,  which has its pros and cons - mainly cons. Most of my new peers have \"zoom fatigue\" which is completely understandable and I 100% had it at my previous place. The problem with it is that it is more difficult for me to **learn through listening**.\n\nI understand that at my current place I am not being payed to learn but I personally believe that spending time speaking to other devs about their practices and what hoops they have had to jump through will save me a lot of time in the long run.\n\nhowever this can be completely argued by spinning it the other way - by discovering things by myself I will learn a lot of surrounding things such as structure of the code base,  best practices, etc... Which I can if the other developers do not yet know go on to teach them. Also by asking questions I will be wasting the other devs time and their time at this moment is obviously a lot more valuable than mine as I am still learning the code bases and systems.\n\nThis problem is obviously emphasized in the pandemic but I have definitely gone through a similar problem pre pandemic.\n\nThere are also different types of devs there are the people who love to help others as they get satisfaction out of teaching people, there are people who love getting features out as soon as possible and it is a scale I would say I urge more on the side of the getting features out ASAP personality.\n\nIt is a very interesting problem and I have no \"side\" on the issue. \n\nI would love to hear from other developers who have been through this.\n\nA message on slack is very official - it requires a written thought-out response and takes a a lot longer and requires much more brain power than a multi tasked mumbled response you can get while sat next to the person in the office when asking something like _\"shall I make this variable a constant?\"_"
