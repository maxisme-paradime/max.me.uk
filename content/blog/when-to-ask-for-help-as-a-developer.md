content = "I have just started a new software engineering role and I am really enjoying it so far although I am struggling with one thing - when to ask for help against when to find out yourself.\n\nThroughout my career as a software engineer I have been learning by doing. There are lots of positives to this and I always tell people who are beginning to code to do this. It can be quite dull following some YouTube tutorial to build a tic-tac-toe game when you are not at all interested in the game tic-tac-toe. I think people who code should be inspired to build things. But this does come at a caveat...  \n  \nI started programming because I wanted to make a fashion brand with a friend of mine from College and we needed a website. I wasn't at all interested in being able to write PHP, Javascript, HTML, SQL, etc... at the time - I just wanted to build an online shop myself. \n\nI got great satisfaction from making new features like a blog page and a CMS panel... and I slowly got more and more interested in building a new feature on the website than I did selling t-shirts. \n\nI had no friends or family who were interested in computers or coding all I wanted was to build features so for a long time I found myself copying and pasting code snippets from StackOverflow -  I was constantly building MVPs but went too far in the direction of wanting to build a new feature than caring about Software Engineering best practices - I didn't have the foggiest about SQL injection, writing comments in my code, Git, etc... I was publishing all new changes to the site over SFTP to a random CPannel host. But out of this I grew a passion to developing products.\n\nFast forward a year and I decided to study Comp Sci at Uni. Where I began to learn about making my code more efficient, secure and readable while writing incredibly boring programs in mainly Java ."
