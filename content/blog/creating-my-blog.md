Which will, in turn, also push me to finish my projects - _final 5% takes as long as the first 95%_ and all.\n\n## Why Hugo and Forestry?\n\nAfter finding a new found love for [Go]() about a year ago I decided to start with a quick Google for _\"static sites in Go\"_ and after confirmation from my friends in the [Go Discord](https://discord.gg/0f1SbxBZjYq9jLBk) server/hive, I decided to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/ \"Hugo\") to build my website templates and [Forestry](https://forestry.io) for writing my content.\n\n# Setting it all up\n\n## Docker\n\n    FROM woahbase/alpine-hugo AS builder\n    COPY . /\n    RUN hugo\n    \n    FROM nginx:alpine\n    COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf\n    COPY --from=builder /public /usr/share/nginx/html/\n\nThis `Dockerfile` first creates a temporary Hugo container to build our Hugo site (`$ hugo`) then it creates a new NGINX container to host our website statically and grabs the generated Hugo site without all the extra stuff that the Hugo package requires (e.g. Go).\n\n### Reducing docker image sizes using `AS` and `--from`\n\nI believe it is really important to try and keep your docker images as small as possible - it reduces storage and bandwidth costs as well as decreasing deployment/development time. A friend and colleague who lives in Kenya spends Â£5 a day on a capped 5mbit/s internet connection. It is essential that he doesn't download large docker images.\n\nThe `woahbase/alpine-hugo` image is [38MB](https://hub.docker.com/layers/woahbase/alpine-hugo/latest/images/sha256-3fd7c6cc56b5140d0e77877b6825838e2fcf5bb85c99b0005913b55a2206ecbc?context=explore) which has already been heavily reduced from the `golang:alpine` image at [128MB](https://hub.docker.com/layers/golang/library/golang/alpine/images/sha256-2de21f4fe5c3557c31b716291a7986c0d54abbd282cd7fb43aaa484672b0c855?context=explore). Our NGINX image, however, is [9MB](https://hub.docker.com/layers/nginx/library/nginx/alpine/images/sha256-fa24815c8e52981d8ef01249e17d46dc5367765814d6feed154f1043aa255b8e?context=explore) + the static files generated by Hugo - which is 14 times smaller! ðŸŽ‰ ."
