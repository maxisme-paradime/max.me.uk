I feel that with most of my projects I have spent a lot of time fiddling with things that I wish someone had given me some advice on or pointed me in the right direction before I started.\n\nWhen learning new skills I often forget about how I got there and what I learned along the way, so I wanted somewhere to simply write out my notes in a blog-like format. Which will in turn also push me to finish my projects (final 5% takes as long as the first 95%).\n\n## Why Hugo and Forestry?\n\nAfter finding a new found love for [Go]() about a year ago I decided to start with a quick Google for _\"static sites in Go\"_ and after confirmation from my friends at the [Go Discord](https://discord.gg/0f1SbxBZjYq9jLBk) hive, I decided to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/ \"Hugo\") to build my HTML and styling templates and [Forestry](https://forestry.io) for writing my content.\n\n***\n\nNow the _chatty stuff_ is over and done with I will start with the _techy stuff._"
