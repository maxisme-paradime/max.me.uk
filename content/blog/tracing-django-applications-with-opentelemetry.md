You can think of a trace as a specific request so every HTTP call will have a unique trace ID. A trace then has many spans which monitor the bits of work within the request for example a database call.\n\n\\[PUT IMAGE HERE\\]\n\nWith tracing it makes it very easy to debug any errors as well as monitoring the perfomance of your application. Latency analysis is very important when you are running any sort of application that has been horizontally scaled (basically every production application) because if your application slows down it can be hard to work out where the bottleneck is. With tracing you can analyse each span to find out how long it took so if you have a single un-sharded database that is hosted in Sydney while the rest of your application is hosted in London the database request spans will likely be a lot longer than you would expect.\n\n## Jaeger\n\nJaeger is a tool to visualise all your traces.\n\n## OpenTelemetry\n\nOpenTelemetry is used to create your traces and spans and send them to Jaeger. It is still in Beta so things can still change a lot but I wanted to use it in my personal applications as it is simplifies the workload and is the future of tacing: \n\n> A single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and collector services to capture distributed traces and metrics from your application."
