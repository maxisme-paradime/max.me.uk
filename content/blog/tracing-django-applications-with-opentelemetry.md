You can think of a trace as a specific request so every HTTP call will have a unique trace ID. A trace then has many spans which monitor the bits of work within the request for example a DB call.\n\n\\[PUT IMAGE HERE\\]\n\nWith tracing it makes it very easy to debug any errors as well as monitoring the perfomance of your application.\n\n# Jaeger\n\nJaeger is a tool to visualise your traces, along with Elasticsearch for it's storage.\n\n# OpenTelemetry\n\nOpenTelemetry is still in Beta so things can still change a lot but I wanted to use it in my personal projects as it is simplifies the workload and is the future of tacing: \n\n> A single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and collector services to capture distributed traces and metrics from your application."
